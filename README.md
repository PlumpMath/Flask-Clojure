Flask-Clojure
=============

flask + clojure-py. An epic combination, apart from various problems.

This project is mainly meant as a demonstration of clojure-py's
interaction with python. It defines a set of helped functions and
macros in utils.clj, and an example website in main.clj.

To run
------

From shell:

    clojurepy main.clj
